1.all the smart contracts are in one file
2.solidity compiler version is imported 7-8 times in a single file
3.safeMath libarary is not requid in solidity 0.8

4.variables in constructor are not used properly :
        require(duration != 0,"Time duration must be greater than 0" );
        require(slicePeriodSeconds != 0,"Interval must be greater than 0" );
 
 corrected:
	require(_duration != 0,"Time duration must be greater than 0" ); //changed
        require(_slicePeriodSeconds != 0,"Interval must be greater than 0" );
